# From Sole to Sale: Crocs Data Analytics

## Introduction  
Crocs, known for iconic and comfortable footwear, has revolutionized casual footwear since its 2002 launch. Structured data was leveraged to explore business performance, customer insights, and market trends. A relational database was designed to model real-world scenarios across sales, products, store locations, competitors, and customer reviews. SQL queries and Tableau visualizations uncovered patterns and trends highlighting brand growth and engagement.

## Project Goals  
Development of a structured relational database for centralized data management and insightful analysis across business operations, sales, customers, and competitors. Extraction of actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making, optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive business growth. 

## ER Diagram & Relational Schema  
A master schema models nine core entities: **sales_data**, **business**, **storelocations**, **competitors**, **customer_demographics**, **CustomerReviews**, **EBayProducts**, **marketingcampaign**, and **ProductCatalog**. Primary keys and one-to-many relationships ensure integrity across transactions, customer interactions, marketing campaigns, and competitive analyses.

## Data Collection  
Archive data for **ProductCatalog** sourced from an internal Crocs directory. **CustomerReviews** web-scraped from Amazon listings. Store location details extracted from the official company website. Financial metrics (revenue, profit, cost of sales, net income/loss) derived from corporate balance sheets. **customer_demographics** and **CustomerType** synthesized as fictional data to simulate demographic distributions. 

## Database Creation  
Tables created according to the ER diagram using SQL DDL statements. Data loaded into structured tables with enforced constraints, data types, and indexes for optimized query performance. Sample records validated across all entities to confirm referential integrity and schema compliance. 

## SQL Queries & Visualizations  
Key analyses performed via both SQL and Tableau:  
- Count of stores by state  
- Average revenue generated by each product  
- Competitors with profit margin above 50%  
- Number of Amazon reviews for Crocs products  
- Proportion of customers by customer type  
- Total revenue and profit by state  
- State-wise units sold per product  
- State-wise revenue, cost of sales, and net profit from the **business** table
  
## Conclusion  
Successful design and deployment of a scalable relational database enabled comprehensive analysis of Crocs data. SQL queries and visualizations revealed top-performing products, state-level profitability, customer preferences, and competitive benchmarks. Actionable insights identified opportunities to optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and sustain market leadership. 

## Future Scope  
Implementation of machine learning models for sales forecasting, customer behavior prediction, and sentiment analysis on review text. Expansion to international markets with multi-currency and multilingual support. Integration of real-time data processing for live tracking of sales, inventory, and customer interactions. Development of personalized marketing strategies and product recommendations based on data insights.
